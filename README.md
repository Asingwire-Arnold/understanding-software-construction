# Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration
**Course:** Software Construction
**Group:** Group 1

---

## Explain the difference between programming and software construction using one real-world example.
Programming is the process of writing code while software construction is the process of using engineering principles such as design, implementation, and maintenance to build efficient and reliable software.
A **real world example** of this is in building a house where programming involves the act of laying bricks and putting materials together whereas software construction involves architects managing the project, designing blueprints and budget planning.

## Describe a situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems.
In a hospital, if a patient monitoring software is poorly maintained, it might use outdated code leading to poor documentation.

## Explain why version control is critical in team-based software development.
Version control allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same code material without overwriting each other's work.

## Describe how code reviews improve both software quality and developer skills.
Code reviews improve software quality by catching errors early, and they improve developer skills through transfer of knowledge to other developers.

## Reflect briefly on how AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning.
AI can help in understanding code by acting as an assistant to a developer through summarizing complex code and translating code into different languages. However, AI cannot replace the critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed by developers to design hence not replacing learning.
